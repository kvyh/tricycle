run (running):

curve_cut with varying width (done with width <=.7)
interpolation with varying width (done with width <=.7)


code and run:
plot a histogram of how many have what ratio. (can do some of)
take a representative sample of the lightcurves and chop them up by found period,
    (take time/period and use from time n to time n+1 or time//period=number and mask by number=1, number=2, etc.),
    then find a sine best fit (define the period but let amplitude and phase vary) for each chunk.
    If the amplitude and phase change it is unlikely to be ellipsoidal variation.

search for peaks in periodogram around .8/

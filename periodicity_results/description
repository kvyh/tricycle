Naming convention:
autocor = results from interpacf's autocorrelation function
periodogram = results from gatspy's fast Lomb-Scargle periodogram
cut = eclipses were cut out leaving a gap in the data
interp = eclipses were cut out and then interpolated over with linear interpolation
# = fraction of the eclipse that is cut out (less leaves more of the actual data/ more removes
                                             more of the influence of the eclipses in the period)
Note: the code ran into errors when run with # > 0.7; I don't know why or if it can be fixed

DATA format:
KIC#  rotation_period   stregth_of_period    orbital_period

rotation_period is the strongest result of the period-finding function
strength_of_period is the strength of that period according to the function
orbital_period is the orbital period of the binary provided by the Kepler Eclipsing binary Catalogue


Other:
The lomb-scargle was run with oversampling=5, and only allowed output periods between .05 and 45 days
The autocorrelation function was only allowed output periods between .2 and 45 days
		(I have no idea why I had used different limits)
The autocorrelation function smooths when finding the period and this can obscure short periods

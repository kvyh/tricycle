run:

curve_cut with varying width
interpolation with varying width


code and run:
plot a histogram of how many have what ratio.
take a representative sample of the lightcurves and chop them up by found period,
    (take time/period and use timee or time//period=number and mask by number=1, number=2, etc.),
    then find a sine best fit (define the period but let amplitude and phase vary) for each chunk.
    If the amplitude and phase change it is unlikely to be ellipsoidal variation.
